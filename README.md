This is the Project of INFO130057.01 Algorithm Design and Analysis for the 2025 Spring Semester of Fudan University. 

Each needs to complete sort algorithm, then choose 2 questions from 20 questions. I choose the question 3 and the question 17.

## Question 3 (Multicolored Spanning Tree)
  Given a connected, undirected simple graph G=(V,E) where each edge is colored red or blue, with ∣V∣=n and ∣E∣=m :
  (a) Design a polynomial-time algorithm to find a spanning tree containing the minimum number of blue edges. Implement the algorithm and analyze its time and space complexity.
  (b) Design a polynomial-time algorithm to find a spanning tree containing the maximum number of blue edges. Implement the algorithm and analyze its time and space complexity.
  (c) Given a positive integer k, design an algorithm to determine whether G has a spanning tree that contains exactly k blue edges. Analyze the algorithm's complexity (expressed as a function of n and m), and illustrate its operation with an example.

## Question 17 (Minimum Number of Brackets to Add)
  The bracket sequence consists of three types: (), {}, and []. For example, "(([{}]))()" is a valid sequence, while "(){}", "()({", and "({)}" are invalid. Given an invalid sequence, design an algorithm to determine the minimum number of brackets to add so that the sequence becomes valid.
